I am a PhD student at the Technion computer science department in Haifa,
Israel, advised by [Dan Tsafrir](http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~dan/) and [Adam
Morrison](https://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~mad/). Starting January 2023, I'm visiting
EPFL as a PhD student with [Ed Bugnion](https://people.epfl.ch/edouard.bugnion).
I am broadly interested in software systems,
networking, and architecture. My current research is focused on improving
performance via new interfaces between Network Interface Controller (NIC)
hardware and host software. I also work at NVIDIA as a software architect.
