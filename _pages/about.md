I am a PhD student at the Technion computer science department in Haifa, Israel, advised by [Dan Tsafrir](http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~dan/) and [Adam Morrison](https://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~mad/). I am interested in software systems, networking, and architecture. Currently, I'm working on accelerating applications over TCP using NICs, while leveraging the software TCP stack. In particular, I'm interested in exploring how new NIC features can imporve system performance. I also work at NVIDIA as a software architect.
