I am a PhD student at the Technion computer science department in Haifa,
Israel, advised by [Dan Tsafrir](http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~dan/) and [Adam
Morrison](https://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~mad/). I am interested in software systems,
networking, and architecture. I'm broadly interested in how cooperation between
networking hardware and system software can improve performance. Currently,
I'm working on accelerating network functions using advanced NIC features, such
as NIC memory. I also work at NVIDIA as a software architect.
