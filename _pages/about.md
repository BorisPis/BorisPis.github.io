I'm a software architect at NVIDIA, focusing on accelerating applications through the use of NICs.
I am interested in systems, networking, architecture, and confidential computing.
Recently, I've worked on accelerating application computations layered over TCP
and novel software/hardware interfaces to reduce NIC driver memory utilization.
